## Password Generator Starter Code


## Desription
    A website that helps generate a random password for your cyber security. The main component that allows your password to be procedurally generated is the use of Javascript math randomization, of course. Use the windows prompt that you will see above when you enter the website where the parameters you set will allow you to completely customize what kind of random password you'd like. From length to custom characterization.
